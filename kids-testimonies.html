							<h3>Janna’s message to current and future parents on improving their actions toward their children</h3>
							<p>"Dear Parents, tutors and adults, remember: you were once children too. Your past doesn't have to shape your future. If you have children or plan to, it's never too late to choose a better path. Please, avoid parental alienation; it hurts children deeply. Be kind and understanding to both your children and their other parent. This stops the cycle of hurt and gives your children a brighter future. Show love and care, and you'll help them grow strong and happy. Build a legacy of kindness, empathy, and unconditional love. Teach through love and positive actions. Heal your own inner child to become a more loving parent. Choose love over negativity. Your children will thank you.”</p>
							<h3>Lulu’s heartfelt speech</h3>
							<p>"My mom had to move abroad for her new job, and I understand she did it for me and for my eldest brother, but it’s so hard being without her. We used to be inseparable. Every day after school, we’d spend hours together. She’d help me with my homework, we’d cook dinner, and before bed, we’d cuddle and talk about everything. She was my best friend and protector. Now, I live with my grandmother, and she doesn't care about me, she’s often busy or too tired to spend time with me. I feel ignored and lonely in my room. I miss so much  my mom’s cuddles the most. She made me feel so safe and loved. Her hugs were like magic, making all my worries disappear. I call my mom every night, but it’s not the same. I can’t feel her warmth or see her smile in person. I miss our weekend outings, the way she’d cheer me up, and baking cookies together. Everything feels empty without her here, the loneliness is overwhelming. I just want her to come back so we can be together again and forever.”</p>
							<h3>Mei-Xia’s memories</h3>
							<p>"Recently, I faced a tough situation at school. While in class, I became emotional and teary-eyed missing my mom dearly. Despite feeling overwhelmed, my teacher advised me to step out instead of providing comfort, stressing the importance of staying resilient. This made me feel helpless and unheard. As a result, I lost my appetite at lunch, making it one of the most difficult moments for me as my mom had to move away for a better life. Why can't anyone see how much it hurts to be without my mom her-love and support?”</p>
					        <h3>Moyo’s sadness and disappointment</h3>
							<p>"The first time the court let me spend Christmas with my dad, I was so excited. Dad promised we’d do cool stuff in the snow with his wife and my little sis. But it turned into a total bummer. Dad didn’t seem to care about me, only about them. Feeling lonely, I buried myself in my laptop. One night, Dad snapped, grabbed it, and threw it against the sofa. I cried all night, knowing I couldn’t tell my grandparents because i knew they would agree with him.. So, I texted my mom, telling her I was let down and wanted to stay with her for good. I kept asking myself why Dad treated me like I didn’t matter. Why doesn’t he care about me? Why did he make me spend Christmas with him if he didn’t want me there? What did I do wrong? He had a chance to be with me for a week, but he seemed bored. Why can’t I have a dad who likes being with me?”</p>
